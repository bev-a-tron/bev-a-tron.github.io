I read "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee the first time in high school. I didn't think much of it.

Then, a couple of years ago, my book club read "To Kill a Mockingbird" when the sequel, "Go Set a Watchman", was released. Wow, it was such a good book!

You can't step in the same river twice, not only because the water has moved, but also because you yourself have changed.

When I was in high school, the only books we read were great books by great authors: Dickens, Shakespeare, Austen. None of the books stood out because I had nothing worse to compare them to.

Fast forward a couple of decades, and I've now read dozens of shitty books by less great authors. I can finally appreciate the high school curriculum because it's finally put into perspective.
