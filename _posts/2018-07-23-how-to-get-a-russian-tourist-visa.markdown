I have wanted to go to Russia since I took a Russian literature class (and found out it was diffcult to visit).

I recently booked a flight to Moscow (it was a lot cheaper after the World Cup!), and so I needed to get a tourist visa.

The process was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. I ended up buying everything before applying for the visa, and not everything was necessary to obtain the visa.

Things I bought before applying:
- Plane ticket
- AirBNB
- Health insurance
- Invitation letter
- Visa application
- Passport (with at least 6 months validity left)
- One color photo 3.5 cm x 4.5 cm

Things the Russian visa office asked me for:
- Invitation letter
- Visa application
- One color photo 3.5 cm x 4.5 cm
- Passport (with at least 6 months validity left)

I followed the instructions on this website: https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1856/russian-visa-requirements--frequently-asked-questions (see excerpt below, in case that page is no longer available).

### Invitation letter 

I purchased this from hotels-pro.ru (go to this website to start the process: http://click2russia.com/). You enter your start and end date for the invitation letter. You can choose the dates yourself. I chose my arrival date and my departure date (because I booked my flight beforehand). Afterward, I read that some customs offices require that your visa be good until the next day. I emailed hotels-pro.ru to ask them to change my end date for the visa, and they did so. I encourage you to add a safe margin around your travel dates.

### Visa application

The visa application required the (1) Name, (2) Address, and (3) Birthdate of the person you are going to stay with (if not a hotel). If you're staying at an AirBNB, you will need to ask your host for this information to fill out your visa application.

I had to write down my two past employers and my direct boss for each of them. Also, I had to write down everywhere I've travelled internationally in the past 10 years.

They didn't ask to see my proof of health insurance.

You leave your passport with them until it's ready to pick up, which will be about 2 weeks later.

Info from https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1856/russian-visa-requirements--frequently-asked-questions:

### When is a visa required? Are there exceptions?
Generally, all visitors to Russia are required to have a visa, obtained from the Russian consulate, regardless the length of the visit.  Exceptions are made for citizens of some countries, having no-visa agreements with Russia. Please check with the Russian consulate in your country if you are eligible for short term entry without a visa.

### How long can I stay in Russia with a tourist visa?
Usually, a tourist visa to Russia is issued for 30 days stay. The maximum duration of your possible stay in Russia will be indicated in your visa.

### How do I apply for a tourist visa for Russia?
Below is the general process of getting a Russian visa. As the process may change at any time, we recommend that you check with a visa support service provider or your local Russian consulate to ensure you have all the information and documents you need:

In order to apply for a tourist visa, you first need an invitation (visa support letter). There are a number of online providers who provide visa support services and issue such a visa support letter (upon payment of a fee). One of these providers is Airbnbâ€™s trusted partner click2russia.com.
Once you have your visa support letter, you can fill out the Russian Visa Application Form online and print it out from the website of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Once you have printed out the completed Russian Visa Application Form, you can apply for a tourist visa at a local Russian consulate or an authorized visa center in your home country by bringing along or sending in the following documents:
- The visa support letter
- The completed Russian visa application form
- Passport - Your passport needs to be valid at least 6 months after your visa expiration date and have at least two empty pages.
- Two recent standard passport-sized photographs of good quality
- In most cases confirmation of travel health insurance for your stay in Russia.

When applying for a visa you will be required to pay a consular fee, which depends on the type of visa, the country where you apply, and your citizenship.
