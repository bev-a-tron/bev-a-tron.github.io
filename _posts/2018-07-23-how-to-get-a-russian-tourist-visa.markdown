I have wanted to go to Russia since I took a Russian literature class (and found out it was diffcult to visit).

I recently booked a flight to Moscow (it was a lot cheaper after the World Cup!), and so I needed to get a tourist visa.

The process was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. I ended up buying everything before applying for the visa, and not everything was necessary to obtain the visa.

This blog post will chronicle the whole process as well as the parts of the process that were strictly necessary to get the visa.
