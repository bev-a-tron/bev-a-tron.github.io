Hello, I’m Beverly. I’m an extrovert, and I’m fine.

Since the shelter-in-place started 20 days ago, people have been worried about the extroverts. Maybe I’m not a typical extrovert, but I actually am quite okay.

I see the glass half-full. Prior to the shelter-in-place, I had a long list of personal projects that I wanted to do, but I never could do them, because my opportunity costs were too high.

My to-do list includes things like writing a book, making a personal website (beverlylau.com; don’t go there — it’s not finished yet), designing a board game, making a phone app for teaching kids about compassion, and finally planting the herbs I got for Christmas.

But if the weather is nice (which, let’s face it, is always true in the East Bay), I will always prioritize going outside over working on a personal project indoors. My argument is that nice weather is fleeting. I’ll write that book or make that website when the weather is shitty. (It’s never shitty.)

But it doesn’t stop at weather. A Nobel prize-winning scientist is giving a lecture? That’s also fleeting. I mean, how often can I just take a train an hour away to go see a famous scientist speak in an intimate setting? I’ll work on my phone app afterward (which I never do, because it’s too late, and I’m tired and I just want to Netflix and sleep).

Friends want to go get brunch? Yes, please! I’m an extrovert, remember? I love seeing my friends. I’ll just design that board game when I’m not seeing my friends. Or sitting in the sun. Or going to see Albert Einstein give a talk.

But now, with the coronavirus on the loose? All of these excuses melt away.

Weather is nice? Too bad, it’s prudent not to go out for too long. One walk per day, not too far from home. Don’t rent a Zipcar, don’t take a Lyft, don’t take a public bus. And as of Friday, wear a mask for your daily walk, dammit!

Lectures? Those were all cancelled a long time ago.

Friends want to get brunch? Nope, gotta social distance. The restaurants are all closed anyway.

So, I’m an extrovert, but I’m also a rule-following citizen. I recognize that it’s better for everybody if I social distance, so that’s what I’m going to do.

What’s left then? Guess I could write that book or design that board game or make that blog post about being an extrovert.

The real reason I’m probably fine is because I’m not sheltering in place alone. Having my partner by my side, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, is plenty of face-to-face time. I might think that it’s the personal projects keeping me sane, but it’s really him. Plus Zooming with faraway friends and having chats with neighbors we run into (remembering to stay at least 6 feet away).

So, I’m an extrovert (living with a partner and a cat and Zooming with friends and chatting with neighbors) and I’m fine.
