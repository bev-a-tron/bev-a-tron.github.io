San Francisco is an amazing place, where there are so many vegan ramen options, you can start getting picky about them! Here is my ranking as of 2016-12-28.

\#1: Mensho Tokyo  
Thick nutty and umami-flavored broth. The best!

Delicious broth, nice noodles.

\#4: Ramen Yamadaya  
Okay, but ramen is obviously pre-made and clumpy.

Pretty flavorless.
