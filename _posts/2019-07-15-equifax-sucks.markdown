In 2017, Equifax lost millions of Social Security Numbers, which prompted many (if not most) Americans to add a security freeze to their credit files at the three major credit bureaus. It's 2019 now and they still don't have their act together.  

Adding a credit freeze to your credit file adds a 10-digit PIN to your account, which is needed before anybody can un-freeze the file or run a credit check on the file. Equifax says this PIN is no longer necessary. They say it's because people call in and have forgotten their PINs. (Uhhh, which is what I would say if I were trying to break into somebody else's file...?) WTF people, this is an important thing, not your Facebook password. Don't forget your credit file PIN.  

In addition to this, their MyEquifax app (only launched a year or so ago) is broken. While trying to un-freeze my account, their website asked several "verification" questions, and after answering all of mine correctly, it told me that my answers were not satisfactory to verify my identity. This scared the crap out of me.  I called their customer service hotline, and the agent told me that their website was broken last night, and many people were not able to identify themselves with correct answers to the prompt. WTF is happening, Equifax??  

Lastly, while changing your password seems to be working, you can't actually login to the MyEquifax website with the brand new password they made you create. Customer support says: Try again in one hour.  

OMG Equifax sucks.
