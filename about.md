Howdy!

My name is Beverly.  I used to do breast cancer imaging research, and now I'm a software engineer.  I 
consider myself to be an honest, rational, and fair person.  I try to live my life in a way that is 
congruent to these values.  I want to help people understand the perspective of others.  Non-human 
animals feel pain and non-human animals want to live.  Since I don't need to kill them to survive and 
since it is plausible to me that they enjoy their lives as much as I do, I choose not to kill or use 
them.

I made the switch from academic research to software engineering because I think I can make a bigger 
impact by building apps and websites that reach millions of people.  There are so many easy problems to 
solve just because people misunderstand people who are different than them.

In my spare time, I enjoy catching up with friends, figure drawing, telling stories, people watching, 
contra dancing, traveling, going to new vegan restaurants, discussing ethics, and petting kitties.
