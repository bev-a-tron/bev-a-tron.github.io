Howdy!

My name is Beverly.  I used to do breast cancer imaging research, and now I'm a software engineer.  I 
consider myself to be an honest, rational, and fair person.  I try to live my life in a way that is 
congruent to these values.

I made the switch from academic research to software engineering because I think I can make a bigger 
impact by building apps and websites that reach millions of people.  There are so many easy problems to 
solve just because people misunderstand people who are different than them.

In my spare time, I enjoy catching up with friends, figure drawing, playing board games, telling stories,
people watching, contra dancing, traveling, going to new vegan restaurants, discussing ethics, and 
petting kitties.
